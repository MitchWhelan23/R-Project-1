# ðŸ“Š Data Analytics & Visualization: CFO Practicum Project

## Overview
This project was developed in **R** as part of a practicum focused on applying data analytics and visualization techniques to solve a realistic business problem. The scenario involved assisting the CFO of Plaxium LLC, Dr. Alicia Kerns, in preparing presentation materials for senior leadership.  

The tasks included **cleaning and preparing financial data, creating professional tables and visualizations, and forecasting future performance** using statistical techniques. The end product was a set of visual and tabular assets suitable for executive-level reporting.

I have included the raw .Rmd file as well as a pdf version of my code.

## Objectives
- Prepare and clean financial time-series data (handling missing values, outliers, inconsistent formats).  
- Create derived variables such as **profit/loss** and structured date features.  
- Build professional tables summarizing quarterly and monthly financial performance.  
- Implement a **forecasting model** using Weighted Moving Average (WMA).  
- Develop a polished **visualization** replicating a CFO-provided example and extending it with forecasts.
